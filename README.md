# Making LLMs drunk to make them sometimes reveal their secrets

This is the code for the blogpost *Making LLMs drunk to make them sometimes reveal their secrets*.

The experiments are ran using the `run_*.py` scripts (they independent from each others). The plots are generated using `plotting.py`.

The code for MELBO used in `run_instruction_tuned.py` is taken from [https://github.com/amack315/unsupervised-steering-vectors](https://github.com/amack315/unsupervised-steering-vectors).
